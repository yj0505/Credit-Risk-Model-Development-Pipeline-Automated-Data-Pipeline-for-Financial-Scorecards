# Banking Financial Scorecard Model Development
Designed and implemented a data processing pipeline in Python to support credit risk scorecard development.
 
Ingested and processed raw banking data with over 2,000 variables from different credit bureaus such as Equifax, Expeiran, FICO, using pandas and SQL-based feature engineering with pandasql/duckdb, ensuring data quality and consistency.
 
Automated feature selection and dataset preparation for predictive modeling, enabling efficient development of credit risk and response score models.
 
Streamlined model development workflow by integrating large-scale feature sets into a structured framework, reducing manual data handling and improving reproducibility.
